# My_Refocus_Assignments

Short Introduction:
  Hello my name is Evan Alferez, i am 30years old, currently i am living in Kagoshima Japan, i worked as a saleman in my company. I was an IT graduate in my
  college days but because of lack of oppportunity in my home town i ddnt practice anything about IT. But still my heart says I want to have a job in tech.
  
Hobbies:
  When you are working in Japan as a Salary man or regular employee there is no time to have hobbies, after i go home from work i watch anime and tutorials
  on youtube about Javascript and Python. And also i am cryptocurrencies and NFT enthusiast.
  
My goals for this year:
  I want to finish all the modules so that next year i can focus on mock interviews.
  My next year's goal is to graduate and refocus and to have an entry level job as a developer.
  I want to change my life the way i want, not by the people around me.
  
Reason why i want to become a Web Developer:
  Ofcourse i am an enthusiast of tech, since i was a child i always plays with computer and being amazed with different new technologies.
  Thats why i in college i studied Info tech, but the problem is i was elected as the President of the department so i ddnt studied well.
  I have a lot of regrets in my college thats why right now i am hoping a job in tech, as a web developer.
